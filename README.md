# Preface
`slurm-to-mqtt-trigger` can be installed as a SLURM trigger and send events to a defined MQTT broker.

# Build requirements
This tool is implemented in Go so, obviously, a Go compiler is required.
Required Go! modules:

* [Go binding for libuuid](https://github.com/nu7hatch/gouuid)
* [Structured, pluggable logging for Go.](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
* [Package ini provides INI file read and write functionality in Go.](https://gopkg.in/ini.v1)
* [Eclipse Paho MQTT Go client](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang)

# Command line parameters

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:---------|:--------------|
| `--help` | Show help text |
| `--mode=job|node` | Trigger mode |
|                   |   `job`  - This programm will be called from job related SLURM triggers |
|                   |   `node` - This programm will be called from node related SLURM triggers |
|                   | *Note:* A mode must be provided, `job` mode and `node` mode are mutually exclusive |
| `--retain` | MQTT message will be retained by the MQTT broker |
| `--version` | Show version information |

The `job` and `node` mode must be the same as for the SLURM trigger, because strigger only passes the nodes or jobs affected by the trigger (see `man strigger` for futher details).

Options for `job` mode:

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `--fini` | Job finished |
| `--time` | Job time limit reached |

Options for `node` mode:

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `--down` | Node entered DOWN state |
| `--drain` | Node entered DRAINED state |
| `--fail` | Node entered FAIL state |
| `--idle` | Node was idle for a specified amount of time |

# Configuration file
The configuration file is in the classic INI format. The only accepted and mandatory section is `mqtt`.

| **Key** | **Description** | **Mandatory** |
:-------|:--------------|:-----------:|
| `broker` | URL of the MQTT broker to connect to | *yes* |
|          | Supported URL schemes are: | |
|          |  `mqtt`, `tcp`         - unencrypted MQTT connection | |
|          |  `mqtts`, `ssl`, `tls` - TLS encrypted MQTT connection | |
| `user`| Username for MQTT authentication | *yes* |
| `password` | Password for MQTT authentication | *yes* |
| `insecure_ssl` | Skip SSL/TLS verification, default is `false` | *no* |
| `ca_cert` | Path to the CA certitifate of the brokers SSL certificate | *no* |
| `qos` | MQTT QoS for messages, default is `0` | *no* |
| `job_topic` | Topic base to send job state to | *yes* if `--mode=job`* |
| `node_topic` | Topic base to send node state to | *yes* if  --mode=node`* |

# MQTT messages
Upon trigger two messages are sent to two different topics below `job_topic` or `node_topic` to simplify MQTT message processing.

## Job messages
In `job` mode messages are sent to:

| **MQTT topic** | **MQTT payload** |
|:---------------|:-----------------|
| `<job_topic>/state/<job_state>` | Job id |
| `<job_topic>/job/<job_id>` | Job state |

## Node messages
In `node` mode messages are sent to:

| **MQTT topic** | **MQTT payload** |
|:---------------|:-----------------|
| `<node_topic>/state/<node_state>` | Node name |
| `<node_topic>/node/<node_id>` | Node state |
